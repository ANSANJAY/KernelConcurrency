Kernel Preemption
=================

Case1: 
	While process A executes an exception handler (necessarily in Kernel Mode), a higher priority process B becomes runnable. 
	This could happen, for instance, if an IRQ occurs and the corresponding handler awakens process B.

	As the kernel is preemptive, a forced process switch replaces process A with B.
	The exception handler is left unfinished and will be resumed only when the scheduler selects again process A for execution.

Case2:

	consider a process that executes an exception handler and whose time quantum expires
	As the kernel is preemptive, the process may be replaced immediately;

Motivation for making the kernel preemptive
============================================

reduce the dispatch latency of the User Mode processes:
	 the delay between the time they become runnable and the time they actually begin running.

Processes performing timely scheduled tasks (such as external hardware controllers, environmental monitors, movie players, and so on) really benefit from kernel preemption, because it reduces the risk of being delayed by another process running in Kernel Mode.
